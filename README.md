# YouTube-Bookmark-Extension
This Chrome extension, built with JavaScript, is a project I developed to aid my study habits. 
It provides a button on YouTube that, when clicked, saves a timestamp. 
These timestamps are then displayed at the top of the Google search bar, allowing for easy access and jumping right into the important parts of the video.
